open**HERTA** is an **open**source **h**omemade **e**vent o**r**ganiza**t**ion **a**pplication which was designed to have a simple self-hostable tool to get around / smash Facebook-Events.

The name HERTA is **for sure not** inspired by the character **Herta Müller** aka "Amazonenkönigin" of the **"Känguru"**-novels by **Marc-Uwe Kling**...

Regardless of these interesting and absolutely random parallels in naming, we are pretty sure that events organized with openHERTA will be at least as cool and crazy as all partys in Hertas "pub" in her apartment,
